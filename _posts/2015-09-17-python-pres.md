Python is a rich environment for all kinds of scientific computing. I recently gave my Lab a presentation introducing a few of the many packages available, including NetworkX, Sympy, Pandas, Seaborn, and more. Click below to check it out.

Also, make _sure_ to go and look into Sympy. I have been absolutely blown away by the robustness of this CAS system, and how much it has streamlined my ability to go from abstract concepts to model, to analysis, to simulation, to results and plotting. Being in Python means you can easily use it with the other modules, and it can return LaTeX (like Pandas can for tables) for any functions/equations you solve for, making report-writing way less busy-work than before.

The Presentation uses the new reveal.js framework used by Jupyter to make slides. Use arrow-keys, and make sure to hit "down" when the indicator on the bottom right highlights (means there are sub-slides). Enjoy!
