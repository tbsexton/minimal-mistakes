Extending upon work done by Aktipis et al. in analyzing the robustness of a [risk mitigation strategy employed by the Maasai](http://www.athenaaktipis.com/Home_files/AktipisCronkDeAguiar.pdf) of Sub-Saharan Africa, this project started with the help of a [good friend](https://theoptimalcasserole.wordpress.com/) when we took a Dynamical Modeling class with Dr. Dieter Armbruster (ASU), who helped [further model the Osotua 'giving' system](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090513814001627) using networks.

In Osotua -- loosely translated as "umbilical cord" -- herders become attached to one or more other herders in an attempt to mitigate potential damages from ecological or logistic disasters. If a herder loses so many cattle as to be below a viable livestock population to sustain himself and his family, he may make a request for assistance from one of his osotua partners. If they are able (without going below a viable population themselves), they are obligated to help -- without the expectation of repayment. This, then, could work the other way around, if 'disaster' hits on the other end.

  * The first part was to replicate the results of the original, dyadic model. Using the same osotua approximations to model two herders in a partnership, the Aktipis results were confirmed using Python with 1Million distinct simulations. The lifespan of a herder becomes very much tied to that of his partner in Osotua, and both are typically able to last longer.

  * Next, the effect of a herder's 'skill' level, and how that propagates through to benefit/harm his partner, was analyzed using normally distributed additive modifiers to the base seasonal  growth rate of a 'leveled' player. Low level has high variance and negative-mean modifier, and high level has low variance with positive modifier  (note the leveling plot is in reverse-leveling order 0 high -> 10 low). It was found that this linear leveling causes an approximately  2nd order decrease in mean lifespan with levels, with the misfortune of a herder only fractionally effecting his (constant-level) partner.

  * The last part extrapolated to simulation of an Osotua network on Small-world graphs (Watts-Strogatz). Then, steady-state wealth and node-degree distributions were compared for various link-assignment strategies (i.e. who does a new herder choose to partner with? How does this effect the network when it becomes stable?) NetworkX was heavily utilized for this section to model the social network dynamics. You can see a large simulation output sample over at the [Osotua Fortress](https://sites.google.com/a/asu.edu/osotua-fortress/the-drama) website, made by another team member.  [<img class="aligncenter  wp-image-744" src="http://archaeo.engineer/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/wealth_net.png" alt="wealth_net" width="677" height="524" srcset="http://archaeo.engineer/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/wealth_net-300x232.png 300w, http://archaeo.engineer/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/wealth_net-1024x792.png 1024w, http://archaeo.engineer/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/wealth_net-846x655.png 846w, http://archaeo.engineer/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/wealth_net-1084x839.png 1084w, http://archaeo.engineer/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/wealth_net.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 677px) 100vw, 677px" />](http://archaeo.engineer/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/wealth_net.png) [<img class="aligncenter  wp-image-745" src="http://archaeo.engineer/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/wealth_deg_comp.png" alt="wealth_deg_comp" width="537" height="333" srcset="http://archaeo.engineer/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/wealth_deg_comp-300x186.png 300w, http://archaeo.engineer/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/wealth_deg_comp-100x62.png 100w, http://archaeo.engineer/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/wealth_deg_comp-846x525.png 846w, http://archaeo.engineer/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/wealth_deg_comp.png 930w" sizes="(max-width: 537px) 100vw, 537px" />](http://archaeo.engineer/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/wealth_deg_comp.png)
  * IN PROGRESS: To extend this simulation, my project for Stochastic Modeling (Applied Math. 541) involves analytically deriving  information about the existence and shape of the herder wealth stationary-distribution on a network, using adapted Markov Chain models. This will be made available on GitHub.
