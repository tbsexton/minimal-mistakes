There is a need for **home-use** immersion cooled PCs. They do exist, but most are not optimized with a home-consumer in mind. Traditionally, the 'all-in-one', or pre-assembled models are for data servers and long-term corporate use. This is changing.

For my Senior Design Capstone, my team and I developed the Cool+Aide immersion cooled PC case system. Designed with aesthetics and ease of hardware modification having utmost importance, the case includes a built-in workbench for drying and tinkering. And your PC will stay as cool as possible: convection flow directed through custom CPU fins and onto your GPU ensures you over-clockers will be ready for anything. Built around the ATX standard, this case accommodates even the biggest of GPUs, while remaining as slim as possible through efficient circulation of the cooling liquid.

Other than function as the Team Leader, my work was primarily in the Detailed Design and Fabrication: full drawing packages are available, with assembly trees for the main and sub-assemblies, and the acrylic was designed to withstand everything thrown at it--laser cut acrylic and a CNC router-cut channel design make this one sturdy animal.

For more information on the design, motivation, and outcome of the Capstone, feel free to check out the final presentation at the link to the right. In addition, contact me if you would like to see the full report, detailing the implementation of the IPDS process throughout the project.
